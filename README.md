# play

Play something while waiting for your command to finish.

Sometimes, you run a program that takes a few seconds (or minute), and you don't really want to do other things while it's running. so instead of sitting there and staring at the screen, play something.
__How do you do it?__ _just prefix your command with `play`_.
